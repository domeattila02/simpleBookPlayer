A little html file that will play your audiobook. Has the most basic design and necessities. However - I was upset how many programs on windows simply just will not remember where I left off my audiobooks. This script will remember. 
Download the source code, navigate to the audiobookplayer folder, type in npm run dev and you are good. Finally I can listen to my hecking books!!
